## Description

**STARK** (Space Technology for Acquisition, Reconnaissance, and K!lling) is a ficticious, advanced, space quadcopter designed for deployment on extraterrestrial planets. STARK's primary missions include:

- **Acquisition:** Locating, extracting, and storing precious gemstones from the planet's surface.
- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering detailed data on terrain, environmental conditions, and potential alien activities.
- **Threat Elimination:** Identifying and neutralizing aggressive and oppressive alien threats to ensure mission and operational safety.

STARK integrates sophisticated sensor systems, artificial intelligence, and autonomous control mechanisms to perform its tasks efficiently and effectively. This README provides an overview of STARK's mission profiles, system architecture, and captured data attributes.

STARK is a Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity model that is used for research and development in the development of Digital Cyber Engineering. STARK will continue to be updated and matured over time to both model and support emerging technologies, analytical needs, and digital tool development.
